# FitbitData
The dataset for this project was taken from our account in fitbit.com where we found our personal sleep, steps, heart rate and other details. We extracted the API from the website and converted it into a csv format. We then visualised our data and preprocessed it and also performed a few supervised machine learning algorithms. Got a 91% accuracy using SVM.
